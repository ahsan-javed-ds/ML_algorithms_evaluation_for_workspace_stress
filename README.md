# Machine Learning Algorithms Evaluation for Workspace Stress-related Issues and Treatment Prediction

Multiple ML Algorithms Evaluation to predict the 'treatment' status in workspace related stress issues

# Dataset:
The dataset has been
taken from an organization named as Open Sourcing Mental
Illness (OSMI) - website: https://osmihelp.org/research.html. The OSMI is a non-profit organization and it
has been working to raise awareness related to mental health
at workplaces specifically in the tech sector. OSMI conduct
surveys every year and for this study, data from 2014 has
been taken.

# Conclusion:
In this given repository multiple ML Algorithms have been evaluated including **Logistic Regression**, **KNeighborsClassifier**, **Decision Tree**, **Random Forest**, **Gradient Boosting Classifier**, **Adaboost Classifier**, **XGB Classifier**, **SVM**, **Ensemble Learning**

- After detailed evaluation, it has been found that **Ensemble Learning** is the best performing model (with an F1-score of 82.23%) on the given dataset of workspace related stress problem predicting which kind of employee will take the treatment, followed by the **Gradient Boosting Classifier** with an F1-score of 81.93%.

- Also, **Logistic Regression**, **Adaboost Classifier**, and **SVM** are crossing the threshold of 80% F1-score on the given dataset.
