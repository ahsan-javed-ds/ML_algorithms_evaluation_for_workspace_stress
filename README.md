# ML_algorithms_evaluation_for_workspace_stress

Multiple ML Algorithms Evaluation to predict the 'treatment' status in workspace related stress issues

# Conclusion:
In this given repository multiple ML Algorithms have been evaluated including **Logistic Regression**, **KNeighborsClassifier**, **Decision Tree**, **Random Forest**, **Gradient Boosting Classifier**, **Adaboost Classifier**, **XGB Classifier**, **SVM**, **Ensemble Learning**

- After detailed evaluation, it has been found that **Ensemble Learning** is the best performing model (with an F1-score of 82.23%) on the given dataset of workspace related stress problem predicting which kind of employee will take the treatment, followed by the **Gradient Boosting Classifier** with an F1-score of 81.93%.

- Also, **Logistic Regression**, **Adaboost Classifier**, and **SVM** are crossing the threshold of 80% F1-score on the given dataset.
